### CS533 Final Project: Container Interference
***

#### Project Description: 
Test the runtime of an application running in a Docker container when applications are running outside of this environment and vying for shared resources. Benchmark the effects on the shared resources, specifically memory, CPU and network. If interference is confirmed, inform the container and migrate if possible.
